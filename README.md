# My personal git and cmder aliases

## Ssh repo link is:

`git@github.com:stanimirgeorgiev/aliases`

## In Windows OS:

Before using current aliases you should have git and cmder installed and working. Have to create ssh keys in order the save command to work.

1. Downloading the repo;
2. Open repo folder in cmder;
3. Copy manually user_aliases.cmd to cmder\config folder by running:

`cp -f ./user_aliases.cmd "%cmder_root%\config" -v`

4. Open repo folder in new cmder window;
5. Run `updatelocal` command; 
6. Reboot;

Hopefully everything should be working!
